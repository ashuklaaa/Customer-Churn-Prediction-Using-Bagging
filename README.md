# Customer Churn Prediction using Bagging

This project demonstrates how to predict customer churn using ensemble learning techniques. It compares the performance of a **Bagging Classifier** against a single **Decision Tree** to show how ensemble methods improve model stability and accuracy.

### Key Features
* **Synthetic Dataset:** Simulates customer behavior (e.g., usage, contract length) using Scikit-Learn's `make_classification`.
* **Ensemble Learning:** Implements **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** to reduce overfitting and variance.
* **Model Comparison:** Directly compares accuracy scores between a standalone Decision Tree and a Bagging model.
* **Visualization:** Includes a **Matplotlib bar chart** to visually represent the performance gap between the two models.

### Technologies Used
* Python
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib
